## Description

Land on the homepage of the site, from here you can go to the index page, show page and login. If you login, then you can create wish lists on the wishlist page, or add them to the shopping cart page. You can also create a product as well. 

I will create this site using python and django.

# Technologies Used:

I built a full stack application for "The Coffee Shop" by using Python, Django, CSS, HTML, Bulma, and Heroku.

# Getting Started:

For the website you land on the Home page where you can navigate to the login page in the navigation bar to create your user. As a user you can add coffee beans products to the wishlist. As the superuser/admin you are able to create, edit, update and delete coffee bean products.

# Next Steps:

My next steps will be building a shopping cart for the site. I will also make the site look more similar to the wireframes created by reworking the CSS and HTML.
